Self-Study of MEAN
The Mean Stack Deployment to Ubuntu in AWS. 
Things require to study in other to implement MEAN
1. OSI model: This is a conceptual model which helps in standardizing of a telecommunication without the regard of its underlying structure or architecture. 
There are basically 7 layers in OSI Moodel:
7. Application Layer: This 
6. Presentation Layer
5. Session Layer
4. Transport Layer
3. Network layer
2. Data Link Layer
1. Physical Layer

Layers 1 to 7 uses the protocol data unit(PDU) 

Application: This layer is concerned with this basic function which is to provide an Application interface by which the client and server can communicate. 

Presentation: Translation of data between Router(or service provider) and an application; This is usually characterised by decrypting and encrypting data.

Session: This is a layer which manages the communication exchange between two end points such as the server or client.

Transmission : Layer 4 which is transport layer has a PDU ->  Segment, Datagram. This layer is used for reliable communication or transmission of data from points on a network.

Network : its PDU is packet, This is a way of structuring and managing muiltple node network including addressing and routing.

Data Link: Its pdu is frame; this layer is concerned with successfully transmitting data frames between two physical devices connected through a physical layer.

Physical : its PDU is Bit symbols which is primarily concerned about the transmission of raw bits

During the implementation of MEAN, I learnt about the "LOAD BALANCING", and its effects on traffic to the back-end server or the client server side. During the implementation I considered the task size , the nature tasks, dependencies, segragation of task.
